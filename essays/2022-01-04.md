This post covers the TryHackMe room, "REvil Corp" which uses Redline to analyze the capture of an infected host.

As an incident responder for "Lockman Group," we need to look at a Redline capture of the infected host. We won't actually grab the capture from the infected machine itself. In the References section is a link to a video by 13Cubed which is an introduction to Redline and discusses grabbing the Redline capture.

## Questions

**What is the compromised employee's full name?**

There are 6 registered accounts on the machine. Standard `Administrator` and `Guest` accounts. There's also  `ANONYMOUS LOGON` and `LOCAL SERVICE` accounts. Lastly of the expected accounts, a user with the hostname of the system followed by a `$` - the "computer user account."

The only unexpected user is `John Coleman`. Problematically, Coleman is a member of the local admin group.

**What is the operating system of the compromised host?**

Checking System Information, we can see that it's Windows 7 Home Premium, v7601, with Service Pack 1 installed.

**What is the name of the malicious executable that the user opened?**

The binary had to get onto the system somehow, and the question saying "user opened" tells me the user could have downloaded the file. Checking the "File Download History" section, there are two binaries: one is in the user's Downloads folder, named `WinRAR2021.exe` and was downloaded from a source URL containing an IP address.

**What is the full URL that the user visited to download the malicious binary? (include the binary as well)**

We got this information in the previous question, again under the "File Download History" section.

**What is the MD5 hash of the binary?**

Opening the "File System" section gives us a tree to select what information we'd like to view in the right-most pane.

Right-clicking on the item we want to examine and choosing "Copy" gives us a CSV of data. We can then find the MD5 table header. You can also scroll all the way to the right within Redline to find the MD5 header.

**What is the size of the binary in kilobytes?**

164 kilobytes.

**What is the extension to which the user's files got renamed?**

There are some `.lock` files, but also some files with extension `.t48s39la` - given the amount of characters in the THM answer field, it must be the latter. I had initially assumed it was `.lock`.

**What is the number of files that got renamed and changed to that extension?**

This stumped me for a second. I was searching in the `File System` section for that extension and got no results. I used the THM Hint and was told to look under `Timeline` for "modified" and "changed" files.

Importantly, the period denoting the file extension must be included (otherwise you'll get more results than you have 'answer digits' for in the THM answer box).

Answer not provided for integrity.

**What is the full path to the wallpaper that got changed by an attacker, including the image name?**

Doing some reading on REvil from [this Intel471 blog](https://intel471.com/blog/revil-ransomware-as-a-service-an-analysis-of-a-ransomware-affiliate-operation), I noted that REvil creates several artifacts, including a **.bmp** file in the temporary directory. 

Heading back to File System, then drilling down to John Coleman's temp directory revealed two .bmp files. One is `John Coleman.bmp` and the other is the answer to this question.

**The attacker left a note for the user on the Desktop; provide the name of the note with the extension.**

A text file resides on the desktop.

**The attacker created a folder "Links for United States" under C:\Users\John Coleman\Favorites\ and left a file there. Provide the name of the file.**

Checking that file location reveals a `.url` file with a familiar file extension.

**There is a hidden file that was created on the user's Desktop that has 0 bytes. Provide the name of the hidden file.**
Navigating there in the file tree yielded two possibilities: one is at the root of the Desktop folder, the other is within a folder under the Desktop folder.  It is not the latter.

**The user downloaded a decryptor hoping to decrypt all the files, but he failed. Provide the MD5 hash of the decryptor file.**

Uh-oh. Users shouldn't try to remediate incidents! I'll provide a hint that this file exists in a location that users regularly access, and is a folder that's pinned to the "Quick Access" section in Windows 10.

**In the ransomware note, the attacker provided a URL that is accessible through the normal browser in order to decrypt one of the encrypted files for free. The user attempted to visit it. Provide the full URL path.**

Check the "Browser URL History" section. This one has a domain that leaps out at you. Hint: it helps to sort by time, "most recent" at the top, and then work your way down.

**What are some three names associated with the malware which infected this host? (enter the names in alphabetical order)**

This stumped me for a few minutes. We know from the room name that "REvil" is one answer, but we need two more. Googling "REvil alternative names" immediately gave one more.

At work I've been trying to make use of MITRE's ATT&CK website a bit more. I know that some malware is listed in the "Software" tab, and indeed REvil is. The "associated software descriptions" section gave the third name.
