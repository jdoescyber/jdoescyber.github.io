This page describes my academic integrity disclaimer, which explains why some of my essays may appear to be lacking full content.

## Respecting Academic Integrity

Long story short:

* I want my posts to have substantial content that someone could glean information from.
* However, some of my researched items could be used in academic settings. For example, Digital Corpora's forensic images clearly mention academic use and provide a solutions key for instructors.

For this reason, **some essays may appear to lack content** or contain phrasing like "to avoid academic spoilers."

Some write-ups will have much more information than others due to this policy. Items which have well-documented and easily-available solutions (like certain TryHackMe rooms) will not be censored.

**At the end of the day, I'd like to help people learn without giving the answers outright**.
