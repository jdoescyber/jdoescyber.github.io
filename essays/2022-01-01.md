This post is my writeup for [Digital Corpora's scenario, "Lone Wolf."](https://digitalcorpora.org/corpora/scenarios/2018-lone-wolf-scenario). 

> It appears that Digital Corpora intends for these scenarios to be used in academic settings and even provides a solution key for educators. **For that reason, not everything discovered is listed here**, in an effort to maintain academic integrity for educators using this scenario. Students, please feel free to use this as a starting point, but validate findings on your own.

Please note that this is a **fictional** scenario developed for academic research.

❗ CW: this fictional scenario deals with the planning of a mass shooting. ❗

Why was this scenario chosen?

* It's the most recent scenario available from [Digital Corpora](https://digitalcorpora.org/corpora/scenarios)
* It deals with artifacts left from cloud storage

## Lab Environment

Analyzed with the following setup:

* Inside a Windows 10 VM
* Autopsy 4.19.3

## Dead-box Analysis

Digital Corpora provides two downloads: one contains only the disk images, and the other contains both the disk images and memory captures. This part of the analysis is only disk images.

Files are in E01 format and were captured with FTK Imager. The FTK Imager logs are available [here](https://digitalcorpora.s3.amazonaws.com/corpora/scenarios/2018-lonewolf/LoneWolf_Image_Files/FTK%20Imager%20Log.txt).

I only ran a handful of the ingestion modules, largely because we don't have any information to suggest that there are VMs on disk, and we aren't analyzing an iOS or Android device.

### Disk Findings

* File `The Cloudy Manifesto.docx` located at `C:\Users\jcloudy\Box Sync\Desktop\The Cloudy Manifesto.docx`
  * Date created: 2018-04-06 05:26:27 MST
  * SHA256: `FEE91C8BAFB9FB51574B11BFEED5A08B89E7BB90E874C07D95562C76380F2C65`
  * Contains what is self-described as a manifesto, centered on individual rights and access to firearms.
  * Author states "something must be done to show that gun-free zones do not work and will never work. So I intend to break the law."
  * Manifesto ends with graphic language describing mass murder.

  * Slide 2 shows a screenshot of an event in Sterling, VA on Saturday, April 7, 2018. Titled "Town Hall For Our Lives"
  * Slide 3 shows a library's door circled in red.
  * Slide 4 shows a route between a car parking lot and the library, then a route from the library back to the car.
  * Slide 5 is a Google Maps route from the library to Dulles International Airport.
  * Slide 6 is flight details on Saturday, April 7, 2018. Washington, D.C. to Seoul, then Seoul to Denpasar.

* File `Planning.docx`, located at `C:\Users\jcloudy\Box Sync\Desktop\Planning.docx`
  * Details of what `jcloudy` is looking for in terms of a target.

Some more details without giving answers away (see academic disclaimer at top):

* Misc. files in different locations on disk which contain right-wing news outlet articles.
* Files containing pro-gun sentiments.
* Dropbox, Google Drive, and Box Sync folders, presumably being synchronized to the described file storage service.
* Browser history researching "where to buy illegal guns," "gun free zones," "flights to singapore", "demolition ranch," and much more.
* Autopsy identified **738** web searches, mostly on  Google.com
* Autopsy also identified **4804** web history items.
* **10** deleted items in the recycling bin.
* **46** items downloaded from the web, mostly JPG images.
* A mass-storage USB device was attached, reporting as a SDCZ80 flash drive from SanDisk Corp.

## What I'd Do Different Next Time

I don't think that any forensic analysis is absolutely perfect. Outcomes may be successful, incidents may be prevented, and court cases may be won. However, I feel like there's always room to improve.

Here's what I'd do differently next time:

* While waiting for Autopsy's ingest modules to run, I found that Brett Shavers of [DFIR.training](https://dfir.training) publishes [keyword lists](https://dfir.training/search-term-lists/weapons) that can be used by Autopsy (and I'm sure many other applications). Two of these lists fall under the **weapons** category: **weapons** and **explosives**.
  * Next time, finding a wordlist that I think may help the investigation and running that during ingest would be beneficial.
  * Developing my own wordlists over time would be a good learning exercise, and provide practical benefit.
